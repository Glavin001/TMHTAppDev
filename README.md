> Teach Me How To: App Development

## About

This is a student directed, online course hosted on GitHub and YouTube for App Development.

Focusing on browser-side and server-side JavaScript & Node.js, API design and implementation, database integration, connecting a client-side to an API, and more. 

When I say student directed I mean that it is much like SMUCSM's "Teach Me How To" sessions and students can recommend what they want to learn, however I would like to make it:
1) hosted online, and 
2) project-based with long-term goals set by interested students.

I have had questions from friends regarding Node.js and browser-side JavaScript, implementing and connecting to APIs, and databases. I would like to develop a complete course for SMUCSM that answers these popular questions and can allow future students and members of SMUCSM to have access to a one-stop location for getting started on Web App development.

I love the "Teach Me How To" events and want to extend them with online presence and more in-depth material.
